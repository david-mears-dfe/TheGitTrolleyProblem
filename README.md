# The Trolley Problem
This repository is an alternate universe that evolves around the trolley problem. The reality of the universe is whatever the master branch says.

# What is happening?
The lever has been pulled in a moment where the top part of the trolley has already passed the branch, but not the back part, making the trolley drift on both tracks and killing six. The fat man is really sad for their families.
